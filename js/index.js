        <p>Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you<br>I'm still alright to smile<br>Girl, I think about you every day now<br>Was a time when I wasn't sure<br>But you set my mind at ease<br>There is no doubt you're in my heart now</p>
        <p>Said: Woman, take it slow<br>And it'll work itself out fine<br>All we need is just a little patience<br>Said: Sugar, make it slow<br>And we'll come together fine<br>All we need is just a little patience<br>Patience</p>
        <p>I sit here on the stairs<br>'Cause I'd rather be alone<br>If I can't have you right now I'll wait, dear<br>Sometimes I get so tense<br>But I can't speed up the time<br>But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider</p>
        <p>Said: Woman, take it slow<br>And things will be just fine<br>You and I'll just use a little patience<br>Said: Sugar, take the time<br>'Cause the lights are shining bright<br>You and I've got what it takes to make it</p>
        <p>We won't fake it<br>I'll never break it<br>'Cause I can take it</p>
        <p>Little patience<br>Need a little patience<br>Just a little patience<br>Some more patience</p>
        <p>I've been walking the streets at night<br>Just trying to get it right (need some patience)<br>It's hard to see with so many around<br>You know, I don't like being stuck in the crowd<br>(Could use some patience)</p>
        <p>And the streets don't change but, baby, the names<br>I ain't got time for the game<br>(Gotta have some patience)<br>'Cause I need you<br>But I need you (all it takes is patience)</p>
        <p>I need you (just a little patience)<br>I need you (is all you need)<br>This time</p>
